# musicrecapp
The main idea of the website is to share what kind of music you like (songs/artists/genres) and to be able to see what music your friends like. 
Some functionalities that I've thought of so far:
- the user can sign in to their own account (and of course sign up when using for the first time)
- the user can make posts (at least text based, not sure yet if image sharing is difficult to implement)
- the user can follow others
- the user can like their friends' posts (maybe also comment?)
- the user will get recommended music based on what their friends have posted (something very simple, I don't want to overdo it)
- i like the idea that the user could personalise their own profile, but I'm not yet sure
